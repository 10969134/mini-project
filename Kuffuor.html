    <div class="l_head">
       <p>Kufuor's political career began in the 1960s when he joined the Progress Party, led by Dr. Kofi Abrefa Busia. However, the military coup in 1966 interrupted democratic governance in Ghana. Despite the upheavals, Kufuor remained committed to public service and played significant roles within the various governments that followed.
        In 2000, after years of political involvement and multiple unsuccessful presidential bids, Kufuor finally ascended to the presidency. He won the elections under the banner of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), marking the return to democratic governance after years of military rule.
        During his tenure, Rawlings implemented economic reforms and pursued policies aimed at alleviating poverty and empowering the marginalized. He transitioned Ghana from military rule to a multi-party democracy in the early 1990s, a process that solidified his position as a key figure in Ghanaian politics.</p>
